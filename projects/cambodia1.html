                Reflection EWB Challenge Cambodia, 2022:
                
                Embarking on a journey with Engineers Without Borders (EWB) Australia in Cambodia was an opportunity that left a profound impact on my life. As a first-year engineering student, I was excited to put my skills to the test and make a meaningful impact on the lives of people living in underserved communities. Our mission was daunting, with complex challenges that ranged from designing a sustainable water harvesting system to educating local schools on STEM subjects and English.

                Once we arrived in Cambodia, we were warmly welcomed by our ex-monk guide, who helped us navigate the complexities of the local culture and language. He was an invaluable asset to our team, facilitating communication with the locals and enhancing our understanding of the local context.

                Before we began our work, our team underwent a comprehensive training program that emphasized cultural sensitivity, teamwork, and sustainability with the guide. We learned about the importance of engaging with the local community to understand their needs and challenges, rather than imposing our own ideas and solutions. We also learned about the importance of sustainability, ensuring that the solutions we developed were effective in the long term, rather than just providing a short-term fix.

                The design of a water harvesting system for a local school was one of the most challenging projects we worked on. We had to consider numerous environmental and technical factors to create an effective and sustainable system. We conducted a thorough analysis of the local environment, including rainfall patterns, topography, and soil conditions. We also considered technical factors such as water quality, storage capacity, and distribution systems. Through this process, we developed a plan that utilized innovative technologies and techniques to maximize the effectiveness of the system, such as combining rainwater harvesting and filtration technologies to ensure the collected water was safe and clean for consumption.

                In addition to our work on the water harvesting system, we had an amazing opportunity to teach STEM subjects and English at local schools. Developing customized lesson plans that catered to each school's specific needs and interests, we engaged students through workshops, hands-on activities, and group projects. It was inspiring to see students think critically and creatively about the world around them.

                Furthermore, during our trip, we had the chance to delve into the country's wealth of cultural heritage and lively nightlife. One of the trip's standout moments was our visit to the ancient temple of Angkor Wat, widely regarded as one of the world's most remarkable architectural and religious sites. We were mesmerized by the temple's stunning beauty and intricate design, particularly as we watched the sunrise in the background. The temple, which dates back to the 12th century, left us in awe.

                Throughout our work with EWB, we were reminded of the importance of working collaboratively and sustainably to create meaningful change. We learned that the most effective solutions are developed in partnership with the local community and that it is essential to build capacity within those communities to ensure the sustainability of the solutions we develop. Our impact-led philosophy was reinforced by the incredible work of other EWB teams working in different parts of the world, who shared their experiences and insights with us.

                Working with EWB gave me a deep appreciation for the importance of engineering in making a positive impact on the world. I saw firsthand the incredible impact that engineering can have on the lives of people living in disadvantaged communities. Through our work, we were able to create effective and sustainable solutions that will have a lasting impact for years to come. It was a truly life-changing experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of such an amazing organization. I look forward to continuing to support their important work in the future.
